netSnarf is built for and runs on Ubuntu Linux.  It should work with other Linux distros, although it has not been tested outside of Ubuntu.
To access the network interfaces, you must be either be root, or have root privelages and use 'sudo' (the build example uses 'sudo').  

To build and run netSnarf:

    $ make [verbose]
    $ sudo ./snarfd [OPTION]
